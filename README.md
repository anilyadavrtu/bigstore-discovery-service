The microservice style of architecture is not so much about building individual services so much as it is making the interactions between services reliable and failure-tolerant. While the focus on these interactions is new, the need for that focus is not. We’ve long known that services don’t operate in a vacuum. Even before cloud economics, we knew that - in a practical world - clients should be designed to be immune to service outages. The cloud makes it easy to think of capacity as ephemeral, fluid. The burden is on the client to manage this intrinsic complexity.
